== Introduction
Refactoring support in your editor might make you lazy, your typing skills might deteriorate as well. But still if it makes
you more productive and/or lets you spend more focus at the task at hand maybe its worth it.

The goal of this plugin is provide Clojure (and hopefully ClojureScript) refactoring support in Light Table.


== Installation
NOTE: **This plugin is not released yet.** If you want try it out you can clone it to the plugins
folder for LightTable (check the https://github.com/LightTable/LightTable/wiki/User-Intro#user-settings[LT docs] for  where)
However you are on your own, you should know what you are doing! Also you might have to compile the plugin and/or reload it's behaviors.
Things are still changing in the downstreams dependencies, which may from time to time lead to breakage.



== Resources
* http://rundis.github.io/blog/2015/clj_light_refactor.html[Clojure Refactoring in Light Table] - Blogcast showcasing some of the features coming to a plugin manager near you

== Usage

=== Preconditions (Important !)
* The LightTable Clojure plugin (bundles with Light Table so a no-op)
* The LightTable Paredit plugin (__TODO: Hoping to get rid of this as a dependency__)
* You need the refactor-nrepl middleware setup (see below)


==== refactor-nrepl
Add the following, either in your project's __project.clj__, or in the :user profile found at __~/.lein/profiles.clj__:
[source,clojure]
----
;; if you just want to try out Dependency autocompletion and find usages
:plugins [[refactor-nrepl "0.2.2"]]

;; If you'd like to try out the bleeding edge stuff (i.e the rest)
:plugins [[refactor-nrepl "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]
          [cider/cider-nrepl "0.8.2"]]
----

==== Limitations
* Profiles are not handled particularily well (ie might throw exceptions, or some operation results in a noop when they shouldn't)
* Some refactorings currently uses **cljs.reader/read-string** to "parse" code. That reader only
supports a subset of clojure's syntax (no-ops and/or exceptions may happen when using reader macros like ', #, @ etc)



=== Threading
These refactorings work without the nRepl middleware, and should work both for clojure and clojurescript
editors.

[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Command
|Description

|Thread fully
|Converts a nested expression to a threaded one (_given that you have provided a recognized threading operator_)

|Unwind fully
|Unwinds a threaded exception (including the threading macro)

|Thread one
|Threads a nested expression one level down.

|Unwind one
|Unwinds a threaded expression one level up

|Thread first fully
|Like thread fully. You don't need to provide the threading operator as a wrapped form before invoking, the form is automatically wrapped with a thread-first macro

|Thread last fully
|Like thread first fully, but with the thread-last macro

|===


NOTE: No formatting currenly. Anonymous function literal blocks are wrapped in strings to allow parsing. So threading within a function literal block is a no go.
Recognized threading macros currently includes : ->, ->>, some-> and some->>


[source, clojure]
----
;; place the cursor somewhere within the outer form and invoke Thread fully
(-> (assoc (assoc {:a 1} :b 2) :c 3))
;; You'll get
(-> {:a 1} (assoc :b 2) (assoc :c 3))

;; If only one arg (i.e function) parens are removed, so thread first fully on the following:
(:c (:b (:a {:a {:b {:c 1}}})))
; yields
(-> {:a {:b {:c 1}}} :a :b :c)


;; Some handling of anonymous functions are handled ok, like
(->> (map #(+ % 1) (filter even? [1 2 3 4 5])))
; yields
(->> [1 2 3 4 5] (filter even?) (map #(+ % 1) ))

----



=== Show definition
Shows definition for a symbol inline. Handy when you just want to have a quick peak
at the definiton of symbol without leaving the context of the editor (and position) you are currently are in.
Think of it like an extended version of the existing LT inline doc function.
Works for both Clojure and ClojureScript.

.Usage
* Position cursor at symbol (typically a function call or referenced var)
* Select command **Clojure refactor: Show definition**
* If found the function/var is displayed inline

=== Introduce ns
Command: **Clojure refactor: Introduce ns**

Adds toplevel namespace definition. Deduces ns from filename of editor and source-paths in project.clj.
Finds project.clj either by explicit connection or searching up for a project.clj file.

WARNING: If you have overridden source-paths in a profile definition in your project.clj. This feature will not
pick up that (currently)


=== Dependency autocompletion
Autocomplete functionality for filling in dependency vectors in your _project.clj_ files.

.Usage: (To be improved!)
* Open project.clj file
* Ensure it's tied to a project connection (Do an eval (cmd/ctrl +l) or invoke the command **Clojure refactor: Ensure editor connected**)
* When you start typing (might lag a little the first time), the autocompleter will suggest from all available clojars artifacts
* When you select an item from the autocompleter one of two things happens:
** If the selected artifact has only one version, the version indentifier is filled in
** If the artifact has multiple versions, a select with version (sorted) is shown for selection

NOTE: This feature has quite a few rough edges, so consider it a incubating idea more than anything else


=== Hotload dependency
Feature to allow hotloading of a new dependeny in your current repl session.

.Usage
* Open project.clj file
* Add a dependency in the __:dependency__ vector
* With the cursor inside the vector for your dep select the command **Refactor: Hotload dependency**
* Any errors are displayed inline

NOTE: The feature only clojars artifacts. Be aware there is no unload feature !

=== Find usages
Finds occurrences of symbols like defs and defns both where they are defined (if available) and where they are used.

.Usage:
* Move your cursor to an applicable symbol
* Invoke the command: **Clojure refactor: Find usages**
* If the editor isn't connected to a project, it will try to do so using Light Table std connect feature.
* Search results are shown in a separate tab for "Find usages" (You can move this tab to a separate tabset, it will be reused for all find usages searches)
* To move up/down the result list use the commands **Clojure refactor: Find usages - move next**/**Clojure refactor: Find usages - move previous**
* To open the selected result item **Clojure refactor: Find usages - open selected** or click on the item

NOTE: If there wasn't a connection for your project in the light table connect bar, you might have to reinvoke the command


=== Rename symbol (Incubating)
Application of find usages that renames a symbol

.Usage:
* Move your cursor to an applicable symbol
* Invoke the command: **Clojure refactor: Rename symbol**
* You are prompted to enter a new name
* Enter new name and press enter
* If the editor isn't connected to a project, it will try to do so using Light Table std connect feature.
* If all goes well the symbol is renamed :)


WARNING: This feature is currently somewhat incomplete. After a rename it doesn't currently reload
namespaces as necessary. (Eval'ing the newly renamed symbol should get you back on track though)


=== Cleanup ns
Will clean up your namespace definition (removing unused, sort etc). See https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl#clean-ns[here] for details

.Usage:
* When in an editor invoke the command **Clojure refactor: Cleanup ns**
* If any cleanup was necessary, your namespace declaration was updated

NOTE: The command works on the file, so you need to make sure you saved any changes to the namespace declaration
before you invoke it. If replacement was performed, the changes are not automatically saved.

=== Resolve missing
Tries to resolve the symbol at point and require or import the missing var.

.Usage:
* When in an editor place the cursor at a symbol and invoke the command **Clojure refactor: Resolve missing**
* If only one result, it is added to the ns declaration, if more than one suggestion is available you
are prompted to select one
* When added the ns form is also reformatted


TIP: Also works for records and types. You can undo the effect of this command using cmd/ctrl+z. This command
doesn't attempt to clean-up or be intelligent about duplicates etc. Thats handled by **Cleanup ns**

.Example - require:
[source,clojure]
----
;; With focus on this token, If you invoke the command with clojure.java.jdbc in your classpath
sql/query

;; The following is added to your namespace :require form
[clojure.java.jdbc :as sql]
----

.Example - import:
[source,clojure]
----
;; With focus on this token, If you invoke the command with clojure.java.jdbc in your classpath
LinkedList

;; The following is added to your namespace :import form
(java.util.LinkedList)
